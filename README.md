# Astrinity♾️

Some astronomists say that the universe is infinite. Some also say that there might be extraterrestrial life outside our planet. Astronomy is the study of anything outside of Earth's atmosphere. This includes things visible or not to the naked eye, such as the Solar System, stars, constellations, galaxies and etc. We made this website which is the database of all astronomy.

- Only a small proportion of the observable universe's tens of billions of trillions of stars are visible to the human eye. The luminous spots we see in the sky are all light-years away from Earth. The actual lifespan of a star is highly dependent on its size. There are also 7 classification of stars with 'O' being the massive and hottest while 'M' being the smallest and coolest.

- A constellation is a collection of stars that has been named and resembles a certain form in the sky. The zodiac is inextricably linked to how the Earth travels through the sky. These signs are derived from the constellations that represent the route that the sun seems to traverse during the year.

- A galaxy is a massive cloud of gas and dust, made up of billions of stars and their solar systems. Gravity holds a galaxy together. The Milky Way is only one of billions of galaxies in the cosmos. It was named after a Greek fable about Hera, the goddess who poured milk throughout the sky.

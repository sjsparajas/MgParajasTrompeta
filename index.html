  <p> Some astronomists say that the universe is infinite. Some also say that there might be extraterrestrial life outside our planet. Astronomy is the study of anything outside of Earth's atmosphere. This includes things visible or not to the naked eye, such as the Solar System, stars, constellations, galaxies and etc. We made this website which is the database of all astronomy. </p>
